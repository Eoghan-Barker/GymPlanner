# GymPlanner
Display lists of exercises grouped by body parts and allows the user to select exercises and create their own workout routine. 
This routine can be saved and loaded from local storage.
The app also has a page for playing local audio files so the user can listen to music while going through their exercise routine.
The data for the exercises is taken pulled from the Wger workout manager api(https://wger.de/api/v2/)
